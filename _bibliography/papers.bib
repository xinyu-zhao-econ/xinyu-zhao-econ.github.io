  title={{Preferences and Investments in Electric Vehicle Fast Charging: A Study of Tesla's Supercharging Network <em>(Job Market Paper)</em>}},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> To combat climate change, the US government has been investing large amounts of money to promote electric vehicles (EVs), especially to build a reliable EV fast charging network. This paper studies the role fast charging has on EV adoption and how Tesla, the largest firm in this industry, is incentivized to expand its fast charging network. I build and estimate a static model of vehicle demand and automakers' competition in prices, and a dynamic model of Tesla's investment decision on its Supercharging network. The demand model features a rich structure on consumer preferences for the fast charging network by incorporating heterogeneous tastes for local and along-highway charging based on consumers' home locations and long-distance travel patterns. On the investment side, Tesla maximizes the present discounted value of all profit streams net of investment costs by choosing its Supercharging network at a very fine level of geographic details. A revealed preference approach set-identifies the cost parameters. The results show that consumers value both types of charging, and that the effects are similar in magnitudes when her local community is covered or when all highways she travels on are covered, both equivalent to a 4 percent drop in vehicle prices. The counterfactual analysis shows the EV purchase subsidy has an expansionary effect on Tesla's Supercharging network, and the effect is larger for community stations and in more developed areas. Ignoring the fast charging network or the adjustments in the network might bias the estimated effects of policy interventions. In particular, it will underestimate the effect of the EV purchase subsidy on consumer welfare and emissions.},

  html={https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1738084},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> This paper develops and estimates a structural demand model which incorporates consumer preferences for geographical convenience of retailers' networks. Unlike the previous literature, which assumes consumers only care about retailer's outlet located closest to their home locations, our model explicitly allows consumers to consider two outlets of a retailer located nearest their home and work locations, respectively. We apply our model to the U.S. retail banking industry. To estimate our model, we use the U.S. Journey to Work dataset to obtain consumers' home and work locations in the population, and combine it with a dataset that details each branch's deposit and location of 132 isolated cities. The results show that consumers value the proximity of outlets to home and work locations roughly equally. In the counterfactual experiments, we evaluate the impact of various Work From Home policies on how consumers value a bank's branch network. In the baseline counterfactual experiment, where everyone is assumed to work from home, the market shares of banks specializing in serving work locations drop by 0.7 percentage point (which is 8.6% of the mean market share in the data).}

  title={{The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession on Less Educated Womens Human Capital: Some Projections <em>(with Mark Drozd and Robert Moffitt)</em>}},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> The recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major declines in employment of women, both from the demand side as firms reduced employment and from the supply side resulting from school closures and the closing of many child care facilities.  We provide projections of possible impacts of this reduction on less-educated women's future human capital framed within the traditional Mincerian model that implies that wage growth falls if a recession reduces the growth of work experience. We develop a new and modified form of the Mincerian log wage equation which we argue captures the effect of women's work experience on their human capital in a way superior to the traditional form of that equation. Using that modified form, we estimate the impact of recession-induced loss of work experience on wages using what we term Cohort IV. Our model, estimated on pre-COVID data, incorporates special features anticipated to be of importance in the pandemic, including the degree to which negative aggregate shocks occur to pandemic-specific industries, whether the impact of shocks varies by telecommuting occupation, and how the impact varies with the presence of preschool and school-age children who are affected by school and child-care facility closures. We find that wage losses one year out from 2020 are relatively modest on average, generally less than one percent, but larger for married women than for unmarried women and for those working in COVID-impacted industries. For married women, it is more severe for younger married mothers, for younger and older married childless women, and for married mothers with older children. School closures are also important for married women with school-age children and increase negative wage impacts by 50 percent. An increase in part-year work projected to occur during the pandemic increases the size of human capital losses.},
