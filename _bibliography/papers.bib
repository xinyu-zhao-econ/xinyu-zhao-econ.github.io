  title={{Preferences and Investments in Electric Vehicle Fast Charging: A Study of Tesla's Supercharging Network <em>(Job Market Paper)</em>}},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> This paper studies the electric vehicle (EV) industry, which has been the policy focus in the two of the last three administrations in the United States to combat climate change. In particular, I investigate Tesla’s investment in the network of Supercharging stations as a tool to promote the attractiveness of its EVs. The model consists of three components: consumer demand for new vehicles, pricing competition among automakers, and Tesla’s investment in the Supercharging network. The demand model incorporates consumer heterogeneity reflecting fast charging accessibility in their home counties and along their travel routes. Tesla’s investment decision features various locations in communities and along highway corridors. I follow the revealed preference approach used by Holmes (2011) and Houde et al. (forthcoming) to set-identify the investment cost parameters. The results show that consumers value access to both in-community and along-highway fast charging and both effects are equivalent to a 4 percent drop in vehicle prices. The counterfactual analysis shows that the EV purchase subsidy has an expansionary effect on the Supercharging network. The effect is larger for community locations and depends on the demographics of the location. The paper also shows that ignoring the Supercharging network or adjustments in the network underestimates the positive effect of the EV purchase subsidy on consumer welfare and emission reductions.},

  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> This paper develops and estimates a structural demand model which incorporates consumer preferences for geographical convenience of retailers' networks. Unlike the previous literature, which assumes consumers only care about retailer's outlet located closest to their home locations, our model explicitly allows consumers to consider two outlets of a retailer located nearest their home and work locations, respectively. We apply our model to the U.S. retail banking industry. To estimate our model, we use the U.S. Journey to Work dataset to obtain consumers' home and work locations in the population, and combine it with a dataset that details each branch's deposit and location of 132 isolated cities. The results show that consumers value the proximity of outlets to home and work locations roughly equally. In the counterfactual experiments, we evaluate the impact of various Work From Home policies on how consumers value a bank's branch network. In the baseline counterfactual experiment, where everyone is assumed to work from home, the market shares of banks specializing in serving work locations drop by 0.7 percentage point (which is 8.6% of the mean market share in the data).}

  title={{The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession on Less Educated Womens Human Capital: Some Projections <em>(with Mark Drozd and Robert Moffitt)</em>}},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> The recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major declines in employment of women, both from the demand side as firms reduced employment and from the supply side resulting from school closures and the closing of many child care facilities.  We provide projections of possible impacts of this reduction on less-educated women's future human capital framed within the traditional Mincerian model that implies that wage growth falls if a recession reduces the growth of work experience. We develop a new and modified form of the Mincerian log wage equation which we argue captures the effect of women's work experience on their human capital in a way superior to the traditional form of that equation. Using that modified form, we estimate the impact of recession-induced loss of work experience on wages using what we term Cohort IV. Our model, estimated on pre-COVID data, incorporates special features anticipated to be of importance in the pandemic, including the degree to which negative aggregate shocks occur to pandemic-specific industries, whether the impact of shocks varies by telecommuting occupation, and how the impact varies with the presence of preschool and school-age children who are affected by school and child-care facility closures. We find that wage losses one year out from 2020 are relatively modest on average, generally less than one percent, but larger for married women than for unmarried women and for those working in COVID-impacted industries. For married women, it is more severe for younger married mothers, for younger and older married childless women, and for married mothers with older children. School closures are also important for married women with school-age children and increase negative wage impacts by 50 percent. An increase in part-year work projected to occur during the pandemic increases the size of human capital losses.},
