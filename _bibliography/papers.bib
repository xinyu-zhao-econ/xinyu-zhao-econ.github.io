  title={{Preferences and Investments in Electric Vehicle Fast Charging: A Study of Tesla's Supercharging Network <em>(Job Market Paper)</em>}},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> The electric vehicle (EV) market has grown substantially in the last decade, along with EV fast charging. This paper studies the role fast charging has on EV adoption and how Tesla, as the largest firm in this industry, optimizes its investments in the charging network both on the temporal and spatial dimensions. To that end, I build and estimate a static model of vehicle demand and automakers' competiton in prices, and a dynamic model of Tesla's investment decisions on its Supercharging network. The demand model features a rich structure on preferences for the fast charging network by incorporating charging needs around local communities and along highway corridors during long-distance trips, and allowing the tastes to be heterogeneous for consumers with different home locations and travel patterns. On the investment side, I model Tesla's investment decisions by maximizing the present discounted value of all profit streams less investment costs, and the decisions are made at a very fine level of geographic details. A revealed preference approach together with a moment inequality estimator set-identifies the cost parameters. The results show that consumer value both within-community stations and along-highway stations, and that the effects are similar in magnitudes when the local community is covered or when all highway segments on a consumer's long-distance trip routes are covered, both of which are equivalent to a 4 percent drop in vehicle prices. The counterfactual analysis studies the effects of EV purchase rebates on Tesla's Supercharging network and finds that the purchase rebates have an expansionary effect on Tesla's network almost everywhere, and the stimulating effect is larger along highways than within communities. Policies that promote EV purchase in areas with lower EV adoption rates can be an effective tool to incentivize deployment of fast charging stations on highway corridors.},

  title={{Consumer Valuation of Network Convenience: Evidence from the Banking Industry <em>(with Hui Wang and Andrew Ching)</em>}},

  html={https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1738084},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> This paper develops and estimates a structural demand model which incorporates consumer preferences for geographical convenience of retailers' networks. Unlike the previous literature, which assumes consumers only care about retailer's outlet located closest to their home locations, our model explicitly allows consumers to consider two outlets of a retailer located nearest their home and work locations, respectively. We apply our model to the U.S. retail banking industry. To estimate our model, we use the U.S. Journey to Work dataset to obtain consumers' home and work locations in the population, and combine it with a dataset that details each branch's deposit and location of 132 isolated cities. The results show that consumers value the proximity of outlets to home and work locations roughly equally. In the counterfactual experiments, we evaluate the impact of various Work From Home policies on how consumers value a bank's branch network. In the baseline counterfactual experiment, where everyone is assumed to work from home, the market shares of banks specializing in serving work locations drop by 0.7 percentage point (which is 8.6% of the mean market share in the data).}

  title={{The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic Recession on Less Educated Womens Human Capital: Some Projections <em>(with Mark Drozd and Robert Moffitt)</em>}},
  abstract={<em>Abstract:</em> The recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major declines in employment of women, both from the demand side as firms reduced employment and from the supply side resulting from school closures and the closing of many child care facilities.  We provide projections of possible impacts of this reduction on less-educated women's future human capital framed within the traditional Mincerian model that implies that wage growth falls if a recession reduces the growth of work experience. We develop a new and modified form of the Mincerian log wage equation which we argue captures the effect of women's work experience on their human capital in a way superior to the traditional form of that equation. Using that modified form, we estimate the impact of recession-induced loss of work experience on wages using what we term Cohort IV. Our model, estimated on pre-COVID data, incorporates special features anticipated to be of importance in the pandemic, including the degree to which negative aggregate shocks occur to pandemic-specific industries, whether the impact of shocks varies by telecommuting occupation, and how the impact varies with the presence of preschool and school-age children who are affected by school and child-care facility closures. We find that wage losses one year out from 2020 are relatively modest on average, generally less than one percent, but larger for married women than for unmarried women and for those working in COVID-impacted industries. For married women, it is more severe for younger married mothers, for younger and older married childless women, and for married mothers with older children. School closures are also important for married women with school-age children and increase negative wage impacts by 50 percent. An increase in part-year work projected to occur during the pandemic increases the size of human capital losses.},
