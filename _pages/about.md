I am a 6th-year Econ PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University. My primary research interests are <b>Industrial Organization, Applied Microeconomics and Labor Economics</b>. 

My job market paper looks at the electric vehicle market and examines Tesla's decision on its Supercharging network. Other topics I have studied include the branch networks in the consumer banking industry, and the effects of COVID-19 on less-educated women's human capital. The Research section has more details on the projects I have worked on.

I will be available for interviews during ASSA and NABE TEC2022, and anytime before or after.
